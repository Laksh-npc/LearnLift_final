            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical process in data science. It involves analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often visualizing them to gain insights. EDA helps to understand the data's structure, detect outliers, identify important patterns, and suggest hypotheses to be tested.

                <h3>1. Descriptive Statistics</h3>
                <p>
                    Descriptive statistics involve summarizing the data through numbers like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range. These metrics provide a quick overview of the dataset's characteristics.

                <h3>2. Data Visualization</h3>
                <p>
                    Visualization is a core component of EDA. Charts like histograms, bar plots, and box plots reveal trends, distributions, and relationships within the data. Visualizing data helps to simplify complex information.

                <h3>3. Outlier Detection</h3>
                <p>
                    Identifying outliers is essential as they can distort statistical analyses. Outliers can be detected using box plots or statistical methods like Z-scores. Removing or treating outliers is an important step before building predictive models.

                <h3>4. Correlation Analysis</h3>
                <p>
                    Correlation analysis measures the relationship between variables. Heatmaps and scatter plots are common tools used to visualize correlations, helping to determine which variables might be predictors in a model.

                <h3>5. Missing Data Handling</h3>
                <p>
                    Missing data is a frequent issue in datasets. Handling missing data correctly is critical as it affects the analysis and model outcomes. Techniques include imputation (filling missing values) or removing incomplete records.

            <h2>Diving Deeper into EDA</h2>
            <p>
                EDA is more than just applying the techniques listed above. It requires critical thinking and domain knowledge to interpret the patterns and insights generated by these techniques. In this section, weâ€™ll take a deeper look at how each technique can be applied to different data types, how to address data quality issues, and the role of visualization in complex datasets.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, EDA can be iterative and requires the use of libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python to efficiently perform and visualize the analysis. Data exploration often drives hypothesis generation, leading to better-informed modeling choices.

            <p>
                Visualizations make data insights clear and are crucial to communicating findings. Good visualizations simplify the complexity in the data, making it easier to detect anomalies, trends, and patterns that could impact decision-making.
