            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Data types in Java specify the size and type of values that can be stored in a variable. Understanding data types is crucial for effective programming in Java, as they determine the operations that can be performed on the data and how much memory it will occupy.

            <h2>Key Java Data Types</h2>
            <article class="type">
                <h3>1. Primitive Data Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Java has eight primitive data types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, and boolean. Each type serves a specific purpose and has a defined size and range.
                </p>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>2. Byte</h3>
                <p>
                    The byte data type is an 8-bit signed integer. It can hold values from -128 to 127. It is useful for saving memory in large arrays.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>3. Short</h3>
                <p>
                    The short data type is a 16-bit signed integer. It has a range of -32,768 to 32,767, making it suitable for saving memory in large arrays where memory savings are critical.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>4. Integer</h3>
                <p>
                    The int data type is a 32-bit signed integer. It is the most commonly used data type for integer values, with a range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>5. Long</h3>
                <p>
                    The long data type is a 64-bit signed integer. It can hold large values ranging from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, making it useful for calculations requiring large ranges.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>6. Floating-Point Types</h3>
                <p>
                    Java has two floating-point types: float (32-bit) and double (64-bit). They are used for decimal values and can represent a wide range of numbers.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>7. Character</h3>
                <p>
                    The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It can hold any character from the Unicode character set, which includes letters, digits, and special symbols.
                </p>
            </article>

            <article class="type">
                <h3>8. Boolean</h3>
                <p>
                    The boolean data type can hold only two values: true or false. It is used for conditional statements and controlling the flow of a program.

            <h2>Diving Deeper into Java Data Types</h2>
            <p>
                Understanding the nuances of Java data types is essential for memory management and performance optimization in applications. This section will explore how different data types affect memory usage, the significance of type conversion, and best practices for using data types effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Java, type safety is a crucial concept that helps prevent type errors at compile time, promoting robust programming practices. This section will also discuss autoboxing and unboxing, which allows automatic conversion between primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes.
