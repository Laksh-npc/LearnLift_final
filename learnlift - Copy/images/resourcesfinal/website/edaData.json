It involves analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often visualizing them to gain insights. EDA helps to understand the data's structure, detect outliers, identify important patterns, and suggest hypotheses to be tested."

It requires critical thinking and domain knowledge to interpret the patterns and insights generated by these techniques. Furthermore, EDA can be iterative and requires the use of libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Python to efficiently perform and visualize the analysis."
